    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Inception is a science fiction heist thriller that explores the concept of "shared dreaming". Dom Cobb, a skilled thief, specializes in the art of "extraction", stealing valuable secrets from within a person's subconscious while they dream. Cobb is offered a chance to have his criminal record erased if he can successfully perform "inception" â€” planting an idea in someone's mind without them realizing. As he assembles a team to carry out this impossible task, Cobb faces his inner demons and the blurred line between dreams and reality.</p>
